"The old timers who built the early web are coding with AI like it's 1995."

I couldn't agree more. There's an element of _play_ to AI that makes technology fun again!

But I worry about costs. Many AI tools cost money out the gate. Old-timers have the means to support that, but a kid new to computer science might not.

The early web was just so freaking awesome for _anyone_ to play with! View source, copy/paste, refresh, repeat. It was so much fun!
