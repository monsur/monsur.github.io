Source control is such a useful companion for vibecoding. Code commits offer a deterministic checkpoint for progress. The determinism is important; I don't trust AI to do the right thing when I ask it to undo a change.

Knowing I have a checkpoint makes me comfortable with giving AI more leeway. I know I can always return to a last known good state. This is important because you never know if your next prompt is going to be the one that triggers a breakage!

Branches also provide a safe haven for trying new things. I can even pit different AI against each other on different branches.
