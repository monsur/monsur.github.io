Claude Code [released an update](https://www.anthropic.com/news/enabling-claude-code-to-work-more-autonomously), and one of the new features is checkpoints.

Checkpoints _"automatically saves your code state before each change, and you can instantly rewind to previous versions by tapping Esc twice or using the /rewind command."_

_"Checkpoints let you pursue more ambitious and wide-scale tasks knowing you can always return to a prior code state."_

This is similar to some of [my observations](https://bsky.app/profile/monsur.hossa.in/post/3lzchguxlpc2w) around source control and AI.

Coding with AI isn't perfect, but it doesn't need to be if it can be more deterministic. Determinism enables us humans to iterate in predictable ways, and gives us the confidence to experiment in bolder ways.
