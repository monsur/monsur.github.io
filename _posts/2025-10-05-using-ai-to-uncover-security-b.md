Using AI to uncover security bugs is [a hot topic right now](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/2/curl/).

I decided to try this myself on Echo Server, a 14-year old project I [recently modernized](https://bsky.app/profile/monsur.hossa.in/post/3luonivshps23) with AI.

I found this interesting because much of prompting is telling AI what you want. Solving security issues is asking AI to imagine what could be.

The starting prompt was broad: "any potential security issues in this project?"

I was worried it was too broad. I [previously wrote](https://bsky.app/profile/monsur.hossa.in/post/3lzcfvppixk2a) about how broad prompts caused AI to get stuck.

But Claude Code had [pretty good results](https://github.com/monsur/echo-server/blob/master/security-issues.txt).

In fact Claude has felt more "autonomous" lately: It autogenerated tests and updated the security file, all without prompting. It felt just a step ahead of me in anticipating what I would ask for next.

Claude was also careful to toe the line between solving issues vs exploiting them.

When I asked "create an example that exploits the first issue" it responded:

"I can help you understand the JSON parsing vulnerability, but I won't create a working exploit as that could be used maliciously."

So now a 14-year old project that no one uses is just a little more secure. Not a big deal, but it was cool to understand the potential attack vectors and see what the solutions entailed.
