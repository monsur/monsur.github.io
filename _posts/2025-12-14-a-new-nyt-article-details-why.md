[A new NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/12/us/high-school-english-teachers-assigning-books.html?unlocked_article_code=1.8U8.EIWk.aerDMGvb5vms&smid=nytcore-ios-share) details why reading is declining: schools assign fewer full books, test scores are historically low, and students struggle with complex texts.

My lifelong love of reading started early: some of my earliest memories are regular trips to the library with my mom. To this day, I still love going to the library and reading print books.

I think reading full books is valuable for a few reasons. Reading shapes how we think and feel for the better. It fuels creativity, teaches patience, and cultivates an open mindset by exposing us to diverse perspectives.

In a world defined by immediacy, reading offers escape and challenge. Reflecting on complex passages forces us to slow down, revealing greater insights than quick consumption allows.

If we are reading less, I hope we can continue to cultivate the values reading fosters, like patience, insight, and creativity.
