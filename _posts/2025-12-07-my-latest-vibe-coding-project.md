My latest vibe-coding project: a weekly automated newsletter that recaps NFL games. More than just a scoreboard, this was an end-to-end exercise in building an automated pipeline from data scraping to delivery: [https://monsur.hossa.in/replai-review/](https://monsur.hossa.in/replai-review/)

A few things I learned along the way:

 * I enjoy building tools to simplify a busy world. This same motivation fueled projects like [plai-ball.com](https://www.plai-ball.com) and older efforts like [Readeroo](https://lifehacker.com/keep-up-with-your-unread-bookmarks-with-readeroo-315538) (a bookmark manager) Realizing your personal passion is helpful for framing future projects.

 * My use of AI has shifted from defining how to defining what I want. With Plai Ball, the AI had highly constrained, specific instructions. Replai Review utilized that specificity, but at a much broader scale. Now, I focus on expressing the intent of the output, not the method of generation.

 * Maintaining coding rigor was hard. Let's face it, its incredibly boring to review _every_ single line of generated code, especially when you just want to get an MVP. I found myself approving everything just to get things working, and then applying more rigor during refactoring.

 * Subscribe at your own risk! I am going to continue making updates and refining the output (I already see a few bugs). I might also change the frequency to next day (vs weekly) for more timely updates.
