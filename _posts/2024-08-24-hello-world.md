This is my first blog post! Welcome to my Jekyll blog.

## Getting Started

This blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. Each post is written in Markdown and stored in the `_posts` directory.

### How to Add New Posts

To create a new blog post:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `_posts` directory
2. Name it with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
3. Add front matter with title, date, and categories
4. Write your content in Markdown

That's it! Jekyll will automatically generate the HTML and make it available at `/blog/`.
