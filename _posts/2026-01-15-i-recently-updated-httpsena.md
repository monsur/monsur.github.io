I recently updated [https://enable-cors.org](enable-cors.org) with the help of Claude Code. AI is simultaneously perfect for updating a site like enable-cors.org and completely eliminates the need for a site like enable-cors.org.

[Michael Hausenblas](https://bsky.app/profile/mhausenblas.info) started enable-cors.org and handed it to me shortly after publishing [CORS in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/cors-in-action). Setting up CORS was a major challenge back then with few available examples. The site's goal was to spread awareness by providing developers with quick, copy-paste configurations.

Maintaining a library of implementation examples is difficult because community-sourced content atrophies over time. As server technologies evolve, keeping every configuration accurate became an impossible manual task.

This challenge is trivial for AI.

I used this as an opportunity to [Ralph](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/), and asked Claude to create an update plan for each file. It then created a script to iterate and implement each plan in a fresh Claude instance.

I went to bed and woke up to a fully updated site.

The crazy thing is I didn't even sit down to do this intentionally. I had a few minutes so I started noodling around, and one thing led to another.

That's the power of AI: casual impact.

Alas, AI ultimately makes sites like enable-cors.org redundant. Instead of searching a library of examples, developers can just ask an LLM for a CORS implementation tailored to their specific stack.

But even without AI, CORS has become largely standardized across modern server frameworks. And that's a success for the enable-cors.org mission!
