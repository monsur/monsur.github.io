Simple and spot-on career advice from [https://joshs.bearblog.dev/being-good-isnt-enough/](https://joshs.bearblog.dev/being-good-isnt-enough/)

A few nuggets that resonated with me:

 * Feedback & humility are key, and support each other: _"Feedback shows you what to work on, and humility lets you actually hear it."_

 * Progress over perfection: _"Don’t wait for the perfect plan, doing something is almost always better than doing nothing."_

 * Above all, just get shit done: _"All of this requires the most important thing of all: agency. And the best part is you can literally just choose to be high-agency. High-agency people make things happen. Low-agency people wait. And if you want to progress, you can’t wait."_
