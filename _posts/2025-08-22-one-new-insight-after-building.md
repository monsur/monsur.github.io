One new insight after [building plai-ball.com](https://bsky.app/profile/monsur.hossa.in/post/3luqdhdmcqs22) and listening to it for a few months: The podcast format requires focused attention. The teams and game scores are mentioned once at the beginning, and if you miss it, you are lost.

I mostly listen to podcasts in the background while driving and its easy to miss things.

Its a good reminder that sometimes our AI challenges are human rather than technical. AI is cool, but it ultimately needs to meet the user's need.

Potential fixes include introducing repetition in the transcript to reinforce key details, or adopting a two-person format (as Iâ€™ve seen other AI generated podcasts use). The two-person format would be more conversational, and give space for the listener to absorb the content.
