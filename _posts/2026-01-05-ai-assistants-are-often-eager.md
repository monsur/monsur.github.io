AI assistants are often eager to jump to the finish line. You’ll iterate once on a design, and it immediately offers to "implement the whole thing."

While it sounds efficient, the output is usually a mess. Vibecoding benefits from small, intentional steps, not one giant leap.

This "rush to the finish" sets a false expectation for beginners. Engineers familiar with AI know how to break complex problems into manageable chunks. But when the AI output does too much too quickly, it can lead to frustration.

AI suggestions should focus on alignment rather than volume. It’s fine to suggest next steps, but those steps should break the problem down into manageable chunks. The goal should to move closer to the user's intent, rather than "do everything"
