My newest vibe-coded project: [LoopTimer](https://github.com/monsur/LoopTimer)

LoopTimer is a simple timer that automatically restarts after each interval. I built it to track rest intervals between workout sets without having to touch my phone.

The app is super simple, but it was my most ambitious vibe-coding experience yet. I built a functional app without knowing anything about iOS development, all while piloting a new workflow.

Since I’d never coded for iOS, I let AI handle all the code and debugging. This freed me up to focus entirely on app behavior. My role shifted from software engineer to product manager, and it was fun!

My new workflow consists of a cloud terminal + tmux. This setup is becoming [more popular](https://willness.dev/blog/tmux-claude-code-workflow) for AI development. Tmux makes it easy to close your laptop while the AI continues churning in the cloud.

However this workflow is tricky for iOS development, since the ecosystem is so Apple-centric. I had to coordinate frequent git pushes and pulls to run the code locally. There are potentially better solutions out there (for example Mutagen), but I didn't mind.

I’m excited to continue refining this setup. Some possibilities: supporting mobile development or voice dictation. Since our input to AI is English, its a natural fit for voice.
