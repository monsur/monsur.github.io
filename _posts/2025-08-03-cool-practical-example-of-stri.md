Cool practical example of stringing together different AI tools to create a demo app. The AI is cool, but I'm _also_ amazed at how this new generation of tooling makes complicated things easy #ai #huggingface #gradio https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio-vton-mcp

For example: Sharing a gradio demo is as simple as setting share=True. That simple boolean does a lot of heavy lifting to make an app appear at a url.

Contrast that to what often feels like hours of getting your environment configs just right to do modern web development.

Hi Monsur

I hope you’re doing well. My name is also Monsur, and I’m interested in purchasing your domain name, https://www.monsur.com. I was wondering if you might be open to discussing this privately, happy to chat over DM here if you prefer.

I’m planning to start a business and believe this domain fits
