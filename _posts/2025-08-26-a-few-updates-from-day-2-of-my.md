A few updates from Day 2 of my latest project: [mirroring my BlueSky posts to a static Jekyll blog](/blog/2025/08/24/another-small-vibecoding-proje/).

First, I liked it so much I made it the landing page for [https://monsur.hossa.in](https://monsur.hossa.in)

Second, and more interestingly, I wanted to refresh the UI to be cleaner. I started by looking into the [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), but Claude actually advised against it:

_"I can help you convert your site to use the al-folio theme, but this will be a significant change that replaces your current Jekyll setup. The al-folio theme is an academic portfolio theme that's quite different from your current simple blog setup."_

So I asked Claude what theme it'd recommend, and it shared a few alternatives, one of which was [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) (the default Jekyll theme).

I like this theme, but Claude had me worried that this would be a large refactoring (and I've had bad luck with refactoring and AI in the past).

Instead, I asked if it could recreate the Minima theme on my site (without actually using Minima).

Here's the interesting bit: Claude visited the Minima GitHub site, "looked at" the Sass file and recreated the CSS in my default template! Very cool!

(Plus I assume this is all legit since Minima is under an MIT license).
