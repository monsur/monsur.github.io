<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Monsur!</p>

<p>I am currently a Software Engineering Manager at Google.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I love being a manager and helping people unlock their full potential.</li>
  <li>I love analyzing complex problems and conveying them through simple narratives.</li>
  <li>I love collaborating with others and being part of a team.
</ul>

<p>I previously lived in NYC for 11 years, and worked at Xanga and Amazon.</p>

<p>I'm also the author of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/cors-in-action">Cors in Action</a></p>
